# Cinema programming challenge
## Challenge 1
The Cinema challenge is from my days in school, where we were set a challenge to write a theatre booking system. The challenge is as follows

A cinema screen has 25 rows of 12 seats. Write a simple command line tool to allow users to reserve seats for guests, and charges them appropriately. The cinema opens at 8am, and closes at 1am. there are 3 pricing brackets
* Morning tickets recieve a 60% discount until 1pm
* Daytime tickets are at a 30% reduction before 4pm
* Evening tickets are at full price until 1am

If the customer books a ticket more than 7 days in advance, they recieve an additional 10% discount.

Assume all films are 3 hours long from the start time. 

##Challenge 2
